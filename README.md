# IOS Webview
An example code of IOS application implementing a WebView Element
I used StoryBoard to manage the activities and the entrypoint for the
application is "ViewController". 

GO to the ViewController.swift file to see the code the buttons that 
I used to open the Activity containing the WebView. It also implements
a safeguard to prevent a crash if the user doesn't have any internet 
because apparently, IOS library doesn't handle that. 

GO to the URLViewController.swift file to see the code that actually
imports and makes use of the WebView element.

Hope you will find something useful! Cheers!
